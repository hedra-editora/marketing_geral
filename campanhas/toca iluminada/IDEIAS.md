"O KAFKA ROMENO" (E A VISITA DE SEBASTIAN)

In September 1936 the author Mihail Sebastian paid a visit to a bedridden friend in Roman, a sleepy town in northeast Romania. He returned to Bucharest “overwhelmed, exhausted, feeling that I wouldn’t be able to come back to life”, as he wrote in his Journal. “Everything seemed pointless and absurd.” His twenty-six-year-old friend had been living “in the intimate company of death”, which Sebastian found both humbling and terrifying.

Sebastian’s bedridden friend was the Jewish-Romanian writer Max Blecher (1909–38), whom Eugène Ionesco (then known as Eugen Ionescu, a promising critic in Bucharest) hailed as a “Romanian Kafka” when he entered the literary scene in the 1930s. Yet in 1928, while studying medicine in Paris, Blecher had been diagnosed with tuberculosis of the spine, or Pott disease. He would spend the last decade of his life recording his slowly unfolding affair with death, in the process producing a haunting body of work at once visionary in its metaphysical forays and unbearably concrete in its portrayal of physical pain and degradation.

The Illuminated Burrow, which was published posthumously (an incomplete edition in 1947, then the full text in 1971), chronicles Blecher’s stays at sanatoria in Berck-sur Mer, France; Leysin, Switzerland; and Techirghiol, Romania. The journal ends abruptly: evidence that it was not Blecher but his mistress, death, that put an end to their affair. Gabi Reigh’s translation is so good that it reads as if Blecher wrote the book in English.

The medical condition forces Blecher to live mostly inside his mind. Closing his eyes, he finds himself in “the same tremulous darkness, the same intimate and familiar cavern, the same burrow, warm and illuminated, flickering with shadows”. Everything that happens in the outside world is filtered through his uncommon intellect, processed almost beyond recognition, then sent back into the world as exquisite, highly penetrating prose
